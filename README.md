## Retail Sales Performance Analysis with Power BI
Author: Royed Alberto Herrera Cano

### Executive Summary

Using Power BI, I analyzed more than one million retail transactions to understand how revenue behaves across seasons, cities, store types, and customer segments. The analysis shows that revenue is very evenly distributed across seasons (around $13.1M each) and that different promotion types generate similar revenue, meaning there are no strong seasonal spikes or promotion-driven changes. Instead of large jumps, the business operates with a stable baseline, which creates a good opportunity to focus on targeted experiments rather than broad discounts.

Based on this, I recommend:

- Monitoring cities or store types that begin to deviate from the current stable pattern

- Testing promotions targeted by customer segment rather than across all customers

- Exploring product combinations to identify higher-margin sales opportunities

### Business Problem

Completed sales are essential for this retail company because they are directly tied to revenue. However, leadership currently lacks a clear, consolidated view of how sales perform across cities, store types, seasons, and customer segments. Although the company processes a large volume of transactions, existing reports are fragmented and make it difficult to answer simple questions such as which customers contribute the most revenue or whether promotions meaningfully change sales behavior.

How can we centralize sales information, understand performance by key dimensions, and identify areas where deeper analysis or targeted experiments could improve revenue?

### Methodology

Imported the retail transactions dataset into Power BI and performed data cleaning and basic transformations (dates, formats, calculated fields such as month, quarter, and year).

Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI that tracks total revenue, total transactions, average ticket size, items sold, and revenue by city, store type, customer category, season, and promotion type.

Analyzed trends and patterns to identify how evenly revenue is distributed across seasons and promotions, and to highlight opportunities for deeper segmentation and targeted business experiments.

### Skills Used

● Power BI: Data visualization, dashboard design, calculated columns, basic DAX, data modeling

● Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, formatting fields, creating date hierarchies (month, quarter, year)

● Business Analysis: KPI definition, trend analysis, segmentation, interpreting results, storytelling with data

● Excel / CSV: Exploring raw data and understanding dataset structure

### Results & Business Recommendations

Creating this dashboard gives retail stakeholders a single place to track sales performance across cities, store types, seasons, and customer segments. By centralizing the data in Power BI, decision-makers can now self-serve instead of relying on manual reports, making it easier to answer common business questions.

The analysis shows that revenue is highly stable across seasons (each around $13.1M) and that different promotion types generate similar revenue levels (about $4.36M each). This suggests that the business does not currently experience strong seasonal swings or promotion-driven spikes, and instead operates around a consistent revenue baseline.

### Recommended Actions

- Monitor cities and store types that begin to deviate from the stable revenue baseline

- Run A/B tests on promotions targeted to specific customer categories instead of all customers

- Analyze product combinations (market basket analysis) to identify higher-margin cross-sell opportunities

- Create customer segments based on average ticket size to identify high-value shoppers

### Next Steps

- Incorporate product-level data to understand which specific items drive the most revenue and margin

- Run deeper segmentation (by ticket size, purchase frequency, or loyalty status) to move from descriptive analytics to predictive insights

- Collect real transaction data instead of synthetic data to validate whether the observed stability across seasons and promotions holds true in practice

- Build automated data refresh scheduling so stakeholders always see up-to-date metrics
